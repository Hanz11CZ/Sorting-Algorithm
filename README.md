# Sorting-Algorithm
Self-implemented sorting algorithm without using high level functions in Python.

Testing:
- Open up your command line, cd into the directory where sort.py is located and with Python installed on your machine type in: "python sort.py".
- It's going to ask you for random numbers separated by commas and it will give you back the sorted array.
- Without using high-level functions (using mergesort algorithm)
